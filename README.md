# Assignment-7

This is a modified falling word typing tutorial from brackeys.

Modifications:
1. Added intro and exit scenes in addition to the main scene.
2. Added an inputField for player name, dropdown menu for color of words, and a speed slider for the falling speed of words.
3. Player name, word speed, current score, high score, and missed words is visible in the game scene.
4. Player name, current and high score is visible in the exit scene.
5. A typewriter sound is triggered on every type.
6. A play again and xit game button is in the exit scene.
7. The word list is read from a file rather than hard coded.
